This project involved developing a wine quality prediction system using machine learning techniques. The system leverages Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn for data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation. Key steps included loading and analyzing the dataset, visualizing relationships between wine characteristics and quality, and training a RandomForestClassifier model to predict wine quality. The project demonstrated the potential of machine learning to enhance decision-making in wine production and selection.
